.PP 
.SS "void Robot::AutonomousInit ()\fC [override]\fP"

.PP
Runs once at the start of auto\&. Usually while the announcer starts counting down from 3\&. This autonomous (along with the chooser code above) shows how to select between different autonomous modes using the dashboard\&. The sendable chooser code works with the Java SmartDashboard\&. If you prefer the LabVIEW Dashboard, remove all of the chooser code and uncomment the GetString code to get the auto name from the text box below the Gyro\&.
.PP
You can add additional auto modes by adding additional commands to the chooser code above (like the commented example) or additional comparisons to the if-else structure below with additional strings & commands\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 94 of file Robot\&.cpp\&.
.SS "void Robot::AutonomousPeriodic ()\fC [override]\fP"

.PP
Runs in a loop during auto\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 110 of file Robot\&.cpp\&.
.SS "void Robot::DisabledInit ()\fC [override]\fP"

.PP
Runs once every time the robot is disabled\&. This function is called once each time the robot enters Disabled mode\&. You can use it to reset any subsystem information you want to clear when the robot is disabled\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 79 of file Robot\&.cpp\&.
.SS "void Robot::DisabledPeriodic ()\fC [override]\fP"

.PP
Runs in a loop while the robot is disabled\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 81 of file Robot\&.cpp\&.
.SS "void Robot::RobotInit ()\fC [override]\fP"

.PP
Runs once on robot boot\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 14 of file Robot\&.cpp\&.
.SS "void Robot::RobotPeriodic ()\fC [override]\fP"

.PP
Runs in a loop while the robot is turned on in any mode\&. This function is called every robot packet, no matter the mode\&. Use this for items like diagnostics that you want ran during disabled, autonomous, teleoperated and test\&.
.PP
This runs after the mode specific periodic functions, but before LiveWindow and SmartDashboard integrated updating\&. 
.PP
