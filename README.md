BaseBot is a complete rewrite of [BarebonesFRC](https://github.com/ewpratten/barebonesfrc) with 2 goals. Do it right, and do it fast. The entire codebase is written in pure c/c++ and some components are being optimized further with the help of assembly analysis.

## Installation
This code can be "installed" in one of two ways. First, is via an official release:

These are the steps:
 - Get the latest release from github
 - Unpack the compressed archive
 - Open it as a folder in vscode
 - Set your team number in wpilib
 - Deploy using wpilib

The second way is to use rolling release / waterfall. Just do the steps above, but use git to clone the master branch instead of grabbing the latest release.

NOTE: 5024 members should always use the second method.
